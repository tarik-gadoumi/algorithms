// 4. fetch is a FaÃ§ade function for a single major feature in the browser called xhr(XmlHttpRequest)
// fetch return  promiseObject thrown outside the  exec context  of createFlow
// which will be  stored in futurData
// this promiseObject is composed of {value:...,status:...,onFullfillement :...}
//onFullfillement is an empty array into which we gonna put any function which we want to  auto trigger when  value get updated
// 5. when data come's back from xhr(Web Browser Feature) value key will in he promiseObject will be updated

futurData.then(doWhenDataReceived);
// 6. .then passes the doWhenDataReceived into the onFullfilment array
